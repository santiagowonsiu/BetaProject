type -- python app.py
go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/views/

it says i have to install sklearn also 

I learnt that is better to work with views.py but each time i forgot to write that in the url referencing, my code didnt work, even copilot often missed it

THREE must be imported from the link and only works online, or you have to download the three js module and have it in your folder

It was easier to go step by step starting my flask environment first, then connecting the camera o running threejs seppately, then threejs but not from a json file but actually fetching from flask then all together in a same website
